# SimpleCalculator

This is simple yet epic calculator.
The reason I made this because well, I cannot see to the screen (class screen and I hate how it's made) as my eyesight sucks.

Features are:
* Multiplying
* Adding/removing numbers
* Dividing
* Automatic (No need to press enter, it has memory)
* Supports floats, up to 1.175494351 E - 38, if you want more numbers, just lemme know.
